### Requirement 1 ###

User can enter a Fahrenheit temperature and the page displays a message
based on the value entered. Use if-else-if statements. Use reasonable
judgment to determine if the appropriate message should be cold, chilly,
freezing, warm, hot, etc. Produce an error message if the value entered in
less than -50 or greater than 140. Use try/catch to handle the error.

### Requirement 2 ###

User can enter a number between 1-12 (error message otherwise – use
try/catch to handle the error). Use a switch statement to output the month
name based on the number entered.

### Requirement 3 ###

User can enter a number between 1-12 ((error message otherwise – use
try/catch to handle the error). Use “Common Code and Fall-Through” to
display the following messages:
• 12, 1, 2: “Winter”
• 3, 4, 5: “Spring”
• 6, 7, 8: “Summer”
• 9, 10, 11: “Fall”

### Requirement 4 ###

Create a birthMonth object with the 12 month names for keys and person
names for the value of each month. For example, January: “Julia”. Use an
HTML element event to call a function you wrote named
displayBirthMonth() that uses a for/in loop to display the month and
person names.

### Requirement 5 ###

Create a month array which contains the names of all months. Use an HTML
element event to call a function you wrote named displaySelectMonths()
that uses a while loop and the month array to display month names
January, March, April, May, and December in an <h2> element.
