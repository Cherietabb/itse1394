### Requirement 1 ###

User can enter a Fahrenheit temperature and the page displays a message
based on the value entered. Use if-else-if statements. Use reasonable
judgment to determine if the appropriate message should be cold, chilly,
freezing, warm, hot, etc. Produce an error message if the value entered in
less than -50 or greater than 140. Use try/catch to handle the error.

### Requirement 2 ###

User can enter a number between 1-12 (error message otherwise – use
try/catch to handle the error). Use a switch statement to output the month
name based on the number entered.

### Requirement 3 ###

User can enter a number between 1-12 ((error message otherwise – use
try/catch to handle the error). Use “Common Code and Fall-Through” to
display the following messages:

* 12, 1, 2: “Winter”
* 3, 4, 5: “Spring”
* 6, 7, 8: “Summer”
* 9, 10, 11: “Fall”

### Requirement 4 ###

Create a birthMonth object with the 12 month names for keys and person
names for the value of each month. For example, January: “Julia”. Use an
HTML element event to call a function you wrote named
displayBirthMonth() that uses a for/in loop to display the month and
person names.

### Requirement 5 ###

Create a month array which contains the names of all months. Use an HTML
element event to call a function you wrote named displaySelectMonths()
that uses a while loop and the month array to display month names
January, March, April, May, and December in an <h2> element.

### Requirement 6 ###

Use an HTML element event to call a function you wrote named changejQueryMessage() that uses a regular expression to replace a user entered string "JavaScript makes me cry" to "JavaScript makes me smile".  Display the modified string in an <h2> element with the font-weight set to bold and the color set to blue.

### Requirement 7 ###

Write and display an example that demonstrates Strict Mode.

### Requirement 8 ###

Create a JavaScript string containing JSON syntax. The array name within the string should be skiResorts and the keys should be: resortName and resortState. For example, Alta and Utah. There should be at least 3 key:value pairs in the array. Use JSON.parse() to convert the string into a JavaScript object. Use an HTML element event to call a function you wrote named displaySkiResorts() that uses a loop to display the contents name and state data of the JSON object.

### Requirement 9 ###

Use an object constructor to create a player object with the following data members: firstName, lastName, height, yearsInLeague. Use the keyword “this” to set the values. Include a function in the object to update the yearsInLeague data. Use an HTML element event to call a function you wrote named initializePlayer() that creates a new player instance and displays the new instance data.

### Requirement 10 ###

Use an HTML element event to call a function you wrote for the player object to update the yearInLeague data. Display the result (a confirmation of the update).

### Requirement 11 ###

Use the prototype property to add a new data member to the player prototype named team. Use the prototype property to add a function to the player prototype which changes the team data. Use an HTML element event to call that function and display the result (a confirmation of the update).
